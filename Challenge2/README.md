#Solar System Simulator
Your task is to create a web version of our [Solar System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System) complete with orbits. You may use any web language you like and it can be as unrealistic or realistic as you prefer. You may start from scratch or use this tutorial from [CodeCadamy](http://www.codecademy.com/goals/web-beginner-en-ymqg0) as a baseline. Good luck and have fun!

##Instructions
Create your solar system with any web based language. Once you are satisfied with the result put your website in a folder named your github username in the Challenge2/Submission directory. Then make a pull request and we will add it to the society repo.
